<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Case Closed: The Phantom of Baker Street</h3>
    <p>
        This was my very first Detective Conan Movie and honestly because I am bias, I ranked this one first.
        This movie is about a highschooler detecitve that got strinked into an elementary school kid by this drug that and organization made,
        and now he has to solve cases and slowly work his way to find the organization, Black Organization, shut them down for good and find a cure to return his real body back. 
        That is the full short summary, but in this movie, he and his friends will be in a virtual reality game that takes them back to 19th Century London, 
        where he has to find the killer of the current time, whom also happened to be a descendant of Jack the Ripper.
        I have more anime movies, but I will leave it like this for now until I want to add more.

<h3>Now You See Me</h3>
    <p>
        If you want to watch magic, this movie is definitely a must watch. Although there are some magic shots that you think are questionable and fake, it just really fun and exciting to watch.
        Now, don't get me wrong, the questionable and fake shots, really shows the "cool" side of the movie, but again, it's really good to watch because there are some magic shots, that the explain how it works.
        So, I would definitely give it a try if you haven't already watched it.

<h3>The Day After Tomorrow</h3>
    <p>
        In my opinion, I really enjoy this movie because there are no antagonist, it is just showing you what the world will become.
        For instinct, you get to see real world problems; global warming, ice age, etc., it just how natural disaster occurred and you won't notice until it actually hits you.

<h3>Midnight Runner</h3>
    <p>
        I'll add another one because I watched this movie when I was taking Korean in College, and the Professor recommend me some movies to watch and take notes of any wordss that I know from the movie dialogues.
        Honestly, at first when I watch it, it was for school, but I end up liking the movie because both the casts were funny and the story line is true, you have to be careful when you're outside alone. 
        Along with having nice police officers using all their abilities to find a missing person.
        It really a great movie to watch.
